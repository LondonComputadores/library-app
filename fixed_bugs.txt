warning: adding embedded git repository: library-app

 - Solution: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22682870/git-undo-pushed-commits
  
  $ git reset --hard <commit id do Ãºltimo ao primeiro 1 por 1>
  $ git fetch --all
  $ git push -u origin +master
  $ git rm -f --cached library-app

  then didn't worked as expected and finally fixed it dragging down the petrone-emberjs-challenge
  to the botton of the project structure, moving this folder to below of all folders and files in
  the VSCode Workspace then coded the following:

  $ curl -u 'LondonComputadores' https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"library-app"}'
  $ git remote add origin https://github.com/LondonComputadores/library-app.git
  $ git commit -m "library-app fixing the submodule problems"
  $ git push origin master (Should be $ git push -u origin master bit it worked without the -u anyway)
